<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][schema-network]

A simple FPS video game with several type of enemies.
The goal is to kill all enemies, with different weapons, without the player's life reaching zero. But after 5sec during which the player has not been hit he recovers 1 life point per second.

The player move by using Z, Q, S, D keys (azerty keyboard), shoot by using left click, display pause menu thanks to H key and change the settings by using arrows.

In the game everything is editable, the number of enemies, weapons, type of enemies and their stats, and the map.

![Product Name Screen Shot][loss-function]

I use raycasting algorithm and DDA algorithm to optimize that. The player projects lots of vectors that determine where the nearest wall is in order to return the distance.

And thanks to the distances I was able to display more or less large rectangles in order to create a perspective.
